# **Natural Selection Simulation**

**By Hamza Shaikh and Prithvi Senthilkumar**

This project attempts to simulate a natural selection system using multiple indepedent species that are capable of interacting with one another over large periods of time. These numerous entities are spawned on a virtual board where they can perform various unique actions during each time step. These actions include walking, running, attacking, fleeing, freezing, reproducing, and much more. Entities can perish if they lack food, sustain too many injuries, or reach the end of their lifespan. As time goes on, the board will thus develop according to which entities are the most fit for the virtual environment. Those entities will end up reproducing, leading to their population growth as long as it is sustainable to do so. Species unfit for the environment will see a population reduction, leading to their possible extinction over multiple generations. We chose to visualize this simulation by constructing an application capable of displaying and modifying individual entities in an adjustable virtual environment using JavaFX.
